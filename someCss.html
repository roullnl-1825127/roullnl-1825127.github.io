	<p>If one could commence marriage with a film, Bee Movie would be my first and only husband. Toting a false picture of a children's movie, this philosophical noir picture shows viewers what it truly means to reflect. Jerry Seinfeld shows us his serious side with a large, looming darkness in his shadowy, somber voice. Taking inspiration from such films as "The Shawshank Redemption" and "Clockwork Orange", Bee Movie sets in stone, a place in film history for the next hundred years. Matthew Broderick shows viewers that his days of Ferris Bueller are long behind him. Broderick takes us on a journey with his guiding voice and poignant acting ability.</p>

	<p>A warning to the weak-of-heart or weak-of-mind, this film will throw your emotions into a laundry mat of exposure and make you think and reflect as you have never done before. I personally credit this movie to my realization that I wasn't spending enough time with my wife and children, moving me so much as to nearly end my own life. But once I finally came full circle with this film, I realized that all Barry wanted was for me to introspectively look at my own soul and body, and find the love for myself that I needed. Thank you Barry, thank you Bee Movie.</p>
